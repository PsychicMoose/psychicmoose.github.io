                        <h2>Get to Know Me</h2>
                        <p>Hey, I’m Daniel—a builder and creative engineer focused on AI, automation, and human systems. I recently graduated <strong>cum laude</strong> from Northeastern University with a degree in Computer Engineering, and I’m now pursuing my master’s in Cyber-Physical Systems while launching my own automation business.</p>
                      
                        <p>I grew up in Fort Lee, New Jersey, the kind of kid who took apart everything just to see how it worked. That curiosity led me to the Academy for Engineering and Design Technology at Bergen County Academies, where I dove deep into 3D modeling, programming, and circuit design. It’s also where I realized: breaking things is fun—but building things is better.</p>
                      
                        <p>Since then, I’ve worked in both hardware and software roles at Sparx Hockey and Stemwave, completed projects ranging from stereo vision wearables to full-stack automation flows, and developed a bias for building systems that solve real problems and ship fast. Right now, I’m helping small businesses streamline client operations using n8n, Notion, and GPT-4—and I’m mapping out an AI-powered voice assistant wearable: minimalist, screenless, designed to support behavior and reflection rather than distraction.</p>
                      
                        <p>Outside of work, I tinker with electronics, sketch out new ideas, journal, and write. I’m drawn to stories with depth, strangeness, and meaning—<em>Murakami, BoJack Horseman, Vonnegut, Community</em>. I also led NUTV’s entertainment department, helping creators take their wildest ideas from pitch to production.</p>
                      
                        <p>Thanks for stopping by, feel free check out my projects below or reach out if you want to build something real.</p>

This meant that I was able to gain experience in almost every aspect of the business in addition to working on my own project. Whether it was helping to implement Salesforce, creating visualizaions and data analysis in Python for the COO, QAing millions of dollars worth of inventory, repairing high and low voltage hardware, or improving the embedded software of the Stemwave device, there was always something for me to sink my teeth into. As far as my own project, I developed a tool with arduino and Raspberry PI that would enable us to verify device functionality in the field rather than having them be shipped back to us. I accomplished this by messing around with different ways to detect force output, until I finally settled on using an accelerometer with a 3d printed case that I designed. This innovation has the potential to save the company thousands of dollars a month on shipping costs, and ensure a smoother user experience for their providers.')">
